# AI-Trip-Creator
The Rolling Capstones

Our task is to create a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that leverages the power of an AI chatbot and virtual assistant to aid users in planning for trips.
At a high level, the web application should achieve the following:
1. Reduce the difficulty of planning trips:
   Reduce the cognitive load that comes with trip planning by presenting the user(s) with curated travel plans that cater to their needs
2. Provide personalized experiences:
   The application should create itineraries based on user preferences to ensure an enjoyable and memorable trip
3. Time and Cost effective
   The application should provide users with plans based on their wants while saving them time (which could be spent preparing for the trip)
   and ensuring that they do not have to pay more than what is necessary for their trip.
4. Provide a user-friendly interface
   The interface should be quick to learn and easy to understand providing the user(s) with all the information they need to ease the process of travel planning.
